To use the script:
1. Copy and paste the script into Maya's Script Editor.
2. Select the root joint of the finger you want to create controls for.
3. Run the script.

This script will create a control for each joint in the finger hierarchy and parent them accordingly. It also creates a simple UI for ease of use. You can modify the script to suit your specific needs, such as adding custom control shapes or additional functionality.
